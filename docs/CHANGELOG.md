[Changes since 2.21.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/compare/v2.21.0...v2.22.0)


## [Release 2.21.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.21.0)

## Summary

> **Warning** We identified [a bug in the .NET Runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/77973) in .NET 5+ that can cause crashes in rare cases. You can mitigate the issue by setting `DD_INTERNAL_WORKAROUND_77973_ENABLED=1`. However, this disables tiered JIT in affected runtimes (.NET 5, .NET 6, .NET 7), which may have a significant impact on application throughput.
>
> Note that setting this flag will have no effect or impact when set for unaffected runtimes. The root issue in the .NET runtime has been resolved and will be released in versions `6.0.13` and `7.0.2` of the runtime. No fix is available for .NET 5. Other .NET versions are not affected.

## [Release 1.25.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.25.0)

## Changes
 * Runtime metrics are publicly available. They can be enabled by setting the `DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable to `1`. For more information: https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/runtime_metrics/dotnet/

   * Traces are now serialized as soon as possible, instead of every second. This reduces the lifetime of Span objects, which in turn should decrease the number of gen 1/2 garbage collections
   * Whenever adding a trace would cause the buffer to overflow, the contents are immediately flushed. This should reduce the number of dropped traces for customers with a very large amount of spans
