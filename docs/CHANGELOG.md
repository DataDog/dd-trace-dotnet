[Changes since 2.5.1](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0)

## [Release 2.5.1](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.5.1)

## Summary

* From now on, _Datadog Continuous Profiler_ is released within the MSI on Windows. It is deactivated by default. Set the environment variable `DD_PROFILING_ENABLED=1` to enable it.
* You can now instrument methods through configuration thanks to the `DD_TRACE_METHODS` variable. Public documentation change is in progress (Install 2.6.0 instead if you want to test this feature as we have fixed one issue when using different versions between Custom and Automatic instrumentation). 
* Finally, the release also brings support for B3 and W3C headers  (#2536).

[Changes since 1.25.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/compare/v1.25.0...v1.26.0)

## [Release 1.25.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.25.0)

## Changes
 * Runtime metrics are publicly available. They can be enabled by setting the `DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable to `1`. For more information: https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/runtime_metrics/dotnet/
 * Changes in the trace buffering logic (#1151) :
   * Traces are now serialized as soon as possible, instead of every second. This reduces the lifetime of Span objects, which in turn should decrease the number of gen 1/2 garbage collections
   * Whenever adding a trace would cause the buffer to overflow, the contents are immediately flushed. This should reduce the number of dropped traces for customers with a very large amount of spans
 * Optimizations in the native profiler (#1224, #1217, #1215)
 * Duck-typing: rename typing cast methods to better reflect the intent (#1220), and add a `DuckIgnore` attribute (#1257)
 * Disable log rate limit when debug logging is enabled (#1239)
 * CallTarget instrumentation:
    * Add support for Redis (#1230)
    * Add support for GraphQL (#1241)
    * Add support for MongoDB (#1214)
    * Add support for ASP.NET MVC and WebAPI (#1208)
    * Add support for CurlHandler (#1252)
    * Add support for Elasticsearch (#1248)
    * Add support for RabbitMQ (#1186)
    * Add support for WCF (#1272)
    * Refactor HttpMessageHandler-based instrumentations (#1258) and enable them by default (#1277)
    * Add fast-path for integrations with 7 or 8 parameters (#1261)
    * Enable inlining by default (#1276)
    * Change log severity (#1278)

 * Various changes to CI integration (#1242, #1247, #1251, #1244)

## Fixes
 * Fix some log messages (#1240)
 * Status was incorrectly reported for NUnit tests with no assertions (#1235)
 * Strengthen type check in the method resolution (#1225) and ducktyping (#1291). This should fix some `BadImageFormatException` errors when loading assemblies into different load contexts 
 * Remove sync-over-async when communicating to the agent through named pipes in AAS (#1218)
 * Calltarget:
    * Don't call `FindMemberRef` when the signature is empty (#1259)
    * Remove useless instruction in the emitted IL (#1267)
    * Properly return a faulted task when an exception is thrown in an instrumented async method (#1270)

## Build / Test
