[Changes since 1.25.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/compare/v1.25.0...v1.26.0)

## [Release 1.25.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.25.0)

## Changes
 * Runtime metrics are publicly available. They can be enabled by setting the `DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable to `1`. For more information: https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/runtime_metrics/dotnet/
 * Changes in the trace buffering logic (#1151) :
   * Traces are now serialized as soon as possible, instead of every second. This reduces the lifetime of Span objects, which in turn should decrease the number of gen 1/2 garbage collections
   * Whenever adding a trace would cause the buffer to overflow, the contents are immediately flushed. This should reduce the number of dropped traces for customers with a very large amount of spans
 * Optimizations in the native profiler (#1224, #1217, #1215)
 * Duck-typing: rename typing cast methods to better reflect the intent (#1220), and add a `DuckIgnore` attribute (#1257)
 * Disable log rate limit when debug logging is enabled (#1239)

    * Add support for Redis (#1230)

    * Add support for RabbitMQ (#1186)
    * Add support for WCF (#1272)
    * Refactor HttpMessageHandler-based instrumentations (#1258) and enable them by default (#1277)
    * Add fast-path for integrations with 7 or 8 parameters (#1261)
    * Enable inlining by default (#1276)
    * Change log severity (#1278)

## Fixes
 * Fix some log messages (#1240)
 * Status was incorrectly reported for NUnit tests with no assertions (#1235)
 * Strengthen type check in the method resolution (#1225) and ducktyping (#1291). This should fix some `BadImageFormatException` errors when loading assemblies into different load contexts

 * Calltarget:
    * Don't call `FindMemberRef` when the signature is empty (#1259)
