[Changes since 1.25.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/compare/v1.25.0...v1.26.0)

## [Release 1.25.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.25.0)

## Changes
 * Runtime metrics are publicly available. They can be enabled by setting the `DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable to `1`. For more information: https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/runtime_metrics/dotnet/

   * Traces are now serialized as soon as possible, instead of every second. This reduces the lifetime of Span objects, which in turn should decrease the number of gen 1/2 garbage collections
   * Whenever adding a trace would cause the buffer to overflow, the contents are immediately flushed. This should reduce the number of dropped traces for customers with a very large amount of spans
 * Optimizations in the native profiler (#1224, #1217, #1215)
 * Duck-typing: rename typing cast methods to better reflect the intent (#1220), and add a `DuckIgnore` attribute (#1257)

## Fixes
