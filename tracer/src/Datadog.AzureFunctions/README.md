## `Datadog.AzureFunctions`

**Note: This is an unsupported pre-release package.**

**Note: If your Azure Functions are running on an App Service plan (aka Dedicated plan) on Windows, use the fully supported [Datadog Azure App Services Site Extension](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/azure_app_services/azure_app_services_windows/?tab=net) instead.**

Add this package to your Azure Functions project to enable Datadog instrumentation.
Further configuration is required for your Azure Functions to send telemetry data to Datadog.
For more information, see the Datadog documentation at https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/azure_functions/
