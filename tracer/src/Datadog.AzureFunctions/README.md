# Datadog Instrumentation Library for .NET Azure Functions
## `Datadog.AzureFunctions`

**Note: This is an unsupported pre-release package.**

**Note: If your Azure Functions are running on an App Service plan (aka Dedicated plan) on Windows, use the [Datadog Azure App Services Site Extension](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/azure_app_services/azure_app_services_windows/?tab=net) instead.**

Add this package to your Azure Functions project to enable Datadog APM tracing.
Further configuration is required for your Azure Functions to send instrumentation data to Datadog.
For more information, see the Datadog documentation at https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/azure_functions/
