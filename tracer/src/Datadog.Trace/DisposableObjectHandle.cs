            // For net45 where AsyncLocal is not a built-in Framework class, we must propgate the ambient context using LogicalCallContext.
            // One consequence of this is that we invoke the System.Runtime.Remoting infrastructure, and if a remote method call or cross-AppDomain
            // method call is made, objects stored inside the LogicalCallContext are transmitted to the other side (aka the "server").
            //
            // For distributed garbage collection, the "server" uses leases / sponsors to keep track of what objects are needed by "clients"
            // (our original AppDomain) and should not be garbage collected. If we do not refresh the lease on objects stored inside the LogicalCallContext,
            // the "server" will garbage collect them and disconnect them, meaning any accesses of the object inside the LogicalCallContext will throw a
            // RemotingException.
            //
            // This solves the problem by returning null so that the lease on the object never expires. To make sure the object doesn't live forever
            // on the "server", we'll use the Disposable pattern to disconnect the object when we no longer need it.
            //
            // This approach is preferred over previous implementations because this InitializeLifetimeService() method will be invoked on the "server"
            // which may be an AppDomain with locked-down permissions, which means this object will not be able to call into SecurityCritical methods like
            // the base.InitializeLifetimeService() method (which will throw a SecurityException) and keep itself alive.
            //
