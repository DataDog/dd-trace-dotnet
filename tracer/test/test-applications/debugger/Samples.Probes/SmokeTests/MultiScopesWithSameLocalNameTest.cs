/// <summary>
/// This test yields wrongful snapshots. We have two locals, with same names but in different scopes (`i` and `localInFor`).
/// As we currently are not taking into account scoping when we resolve local index -> name, 
/// we might capture the wrong local at the wrong location.
/// In this example, we place a line probe on line 25 (first for loop), expected to see the value of the locals 
/// at this location but we accidently capture the `i` and `localInFor` that are in the scope of the second for loop (as they override the `i` and `localInFor` of the first loop, because of the same naming)
/// thus they will see the value '0' in the snapshots instead of having their real value.
