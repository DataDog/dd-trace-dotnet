# ASP.NET Docker Sample
This sample demonstrates how to build and deploy an ASP.NET Framework application in IIS using a Windows container. This also demonstrates how to configure environment variables using at the time of container startup, which may be the earliest that time that IP's and networking values are populated.

## Build and Run
To build and run the application, open a terminal in this directory and run the following commands:

```console
docker build -t iis .
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:80 iis
```

Note: The application build is done entirely inside the Windows container, which means pulling the `dotnet/framework/sdk` image before starting the build. If you already have a .NET Framework SDK installed, you may want to instead build the application locally and copy the published binaries into the runtime container.
