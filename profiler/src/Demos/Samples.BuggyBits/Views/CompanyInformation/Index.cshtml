<h2>Company Information</h2>
<p>Buggy Bits was established in 1994 as a one-man company delivering really buggy software and t-shirts noone would ever wear.</p>
<p>
    Since then it has grown into a large organization with over 1754 employees and the main focus for the
    company today is to sell worthless products at horribly high
    prices.
