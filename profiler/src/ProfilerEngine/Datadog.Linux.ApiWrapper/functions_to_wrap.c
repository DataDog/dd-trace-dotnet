/* dl_iterate_phdr wrapper
The .NET profiler on Linux uses a classic signal-based approach to collect thread callstack.
Which means that we send a signal (USR1 or USR2) to the thread we want to collect. When the thread handles the signal
it calls the signal handler and the thread will start to walk its callstack using libunwind.
In order to correctly unwind the callstack, libunwind locates the symbol associated to an instruction pointer by calling dl_iterate_phdr.
dl_iterated_phdr will go over the loaded shared objects and execute the callback libunwind provided.

When an exception is thrown, the CLR call libc/libgcc functions to unwind the callstack. Same as libunwind, to
correctly unwind the stack it will call dl_iterate_phdr.

Before going through the list of shared object, dl_iterate_phdr will acquire a lock to avoid modification of that list.

The deadlock:
An exception is thrown during an application thread execution. The CLR unwinds the callstack and a call to dl_iterate_phdr is made.
The lock is acquired. But at the same time, a signal is sent to the same thread and its execution is hijacked by the profiler.
The hijacked thread will start walking its callstack and a call to dl_iterate_phdr will be made. But it seems that the lock in
dl_iterate_phdr is not recursive and the thread is blocked.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Fix
We will rely on LD_PRELOAD mechanism to inject our own implementation of dl_iterate_phdr.
Before calling the real dl_iterate_phdr, we block all signals that would intefere with the thread.
Then will call the real dl_iterate_phdr.
When finished, we put back the previous block signals.

This is done by libunwind, just taking advantage of it.
