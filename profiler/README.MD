# dd-trace-dotnet/profiler

## Note

Currently, this directory is empty.
It is a placeholder for the Profiler sources, which will be available here in the future.
In the meantime, the Profiler is available as a private preview via [dd-continuous-profiler-dotnet](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-continuous-profiler-dotnet).
