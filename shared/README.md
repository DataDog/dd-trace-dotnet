This repo ([dd-trace-dotnet](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet)) contains the sources for the client-side components of the Datadog product suite for Application Telemetry Collection and Application Performance Monitoring for .NET Applications.

This directory (`/shared`) contains code that is shared between the different products of that suite (.NET Tracer, .NET Profiler, etc...).

The actually shared assets are contained in `/shared/src` and `/shared/resources` respectively. The corresponding tests, usage samples, etc are contained in sibling directories (`/shared/test`, `/shared/samples`, etc...);
